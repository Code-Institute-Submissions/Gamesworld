Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15 in North America, November 29 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014, in Japan. It competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and Nintendo's Wii U and Switch.</p>\n\n        <p>Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the \"most powerful\" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices (\"Remote Play\"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely (\"Share Play\"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia.</p>\n\n        <p>The PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing independent game development, and for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as \"significant\" and \"obvious\". Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By the end of December 2018, over 94 million PlayStation 4 consoles had been shipped worldwide, surpassing lifetime sales of the PlayStation 3.</p>\n\n        <p>On September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU clock rate to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games.</p>\n\n        </section>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid games-1\">\n    <div class=\"center\">\n  <h2>Xbox One</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg\">\n      <img src=\"assests/images/xbox.jpg\" alt=\"xbox\">\n         </div>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg\">\n       <section class=\"games-1\">\n<p>The Xbox One was released on November 22, 2013, in North America, as the successor of the Xbox 360. The Xbox One competes with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U and Switch as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles.</p>\n\n<p>Announced on May 21, 2013, the Xbox One has an emphasis on internet-based features, including the ability to record and stream gameplay, and the ability to integrate with a set-top box to watch cable or satellite TV through the console with an enhanced guide interface and Kinect-based voice control.</p>\n\n<p>Following its unveiling, the Xbox One proved controversial for its original digital rights management and privacy practices; while Microsoft touted the ability for users to access their library of games (regardless of whether they were purchased physically or digitally) on any Xbox One console without needing their discs, and the ability to share their entire library with 10 designated \"family\" members, all games would have to be tied to the user's Xbox Live account and their Xbox One console, and the console would be required to connect to the Internet on a periodic basis (at least once every 24 hours) to synchronize the library, or else the console would be unable to play any games at all. After an overwhelmingly negative response from critics and consumers (who also showed concerns that the system could prevent or hinder the resale of used games), Microsoft announced that these restrictions would be dropped. Microsoft was also criticized for requiring the Xbox One to have its updated Kinect peripheral plugged in to function, which critics and privacy advocates believed could be used as a surveillance device. As a gesture toward showing a commitment to user privacy, Microsoft decided to allow the console to function without Kinect.</p>\n\n<p>On June 13, 2016, Microsoft announced the Xbox One S, a slimmer version of the Xbox One, at E3 2016. Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, announced Project Scorpio at E3 2016 on June 13, 2016, an addition to the Xbox One family, saying it would release in Holiday 2017. At E3 2017, Microsoft revealed the final name of the console to be Xbox One X, and that it would start shipping worldwide on November 7, 2017 for a final retail price of $499.</p>\n     </section>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid games-2\">\n    <div class=\"center\">\n  <h2>Nintendo Switch</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg\">\n      <img src=\"assests/images/nintendo switch.jpg\" alt=\"nintendo\">\n         </div>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg\">\n       <section class=\"games-2\">\n\n<p>The Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by Nintendo, released on March 3, 2017. It is a hybrid console that can be used as a stationary and portable device. Its wireless Joy-Con controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play. They can also connect to a Grip accessory to provide a traditional home console gamepad form, or be used individually in the hand like the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software supports online gaming through Internet connectivity, as well as local wireless ad hoc connectivity with other Switch consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on both physical flash-based ROM cartridges and digital distribution via Nintendo eShop; the system does not use region locking. As an eighth-generation console, the Nintendo Switch competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4.</p>\n\n<p>Known in development by its codename NX, the concept of the Switch came about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U, and market competition from mobile gaming. Nintendo's then-president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Nintendo Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through the multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on Nvidia's Tegra line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing game engines. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third-party developers and publishers to help build out the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's own first-party titles, including many independent video game studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 titles for its first year, over 320 titles from first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the end of 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The Nintendo Switch was unveiled in October 2016 and was released in most areas worldwide on March 3, 2017. The console shipped nearly three million in the first month of its launch, exceeding Nintendo's initial projection of two million, and within a year of release achieved over 14 million units sold worldwide, outselling total lifetime sales of the Wii U. By the start of 2018, the Switch became the fastest-selling home console in both Japan and the United States. As of December 2018, the Nintendo Switch has sold more than 32 million units worldwide. Switch sales have been strongly tied to sales of Nintendo's first-party titles, with five games, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Pokémon: Let's Go having sold over ten million units each. A handheld-focused revision of the system, called the Nintendo Switch Lite, was released on September 20, 2019.</p>\n\n     </section>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<!-- completed footer and links set up within container working correctly and displaying as required\n\nspacing added for the footer to move the detail away from the video clip for more vision on the detail\n-->\n<footer class=\"container-fluid footerbox\" id=\"footer\">\n    <div class=\"col-12\">\n        <div class=\"container icons\">\n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\"><i class=\"fab fa-facebook\">\n                    </i></a>\n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\"><i class=\"fab fa-instagram\">\n                    </i></a>\n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/\"><i class=\"fab fa-twitter\">\n                    </i></a>\n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\"><i class=\"fab fa-youtube\">\n                    </i></a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</footer>\n\n\n\n\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n","undoManager":{"mark":0,"position":1,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":17,"column":7},"action":"remove","lines":["<!DOCTYPE html>","<html>","","<head>","    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">","    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">","    <title>Gaming World</title>","    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.2.1/css/bootstrap.min.css\" type=\"text/css\" />","    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hover.css/2.1.1/css/hover-min.css\" type=\"text/css\">","    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.1/css/all.css\" integrity=\"sha384-gfdkjb5BdAXd+lj+gudLWI+BXq4IuLW5IT+brZEZsLFm++aCMlF1V92rMkPaX4PP\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">","    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.emailjs.com/sdk/2.3.2/email.min.js\"></script>","","","","","","    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assests/css/style.css\" type=\"text/css\">","</head>"],"id":119},{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":18,"column":7},"action":"insert","lines":["<!DOCTYPE html>","<html>","","<head>","    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">","    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">","    <title>Gaming World</title>","    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.2.1/css/bootstrap.min.css\" type=\"text/css\" />","    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hover.css/2.1.1/css/hover-min.css\" type=\"text/css\">","    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.1/css/all.css\" integrity=\"sha384-gfdkjb5BdAXd+lj+gudLWI+BXq4IuLW5IT+brZEZsLFm++aCMlF1V92rMkPaX4PP\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">","    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.emailjs.com/sdk/2.3.2/email.min.js\"></script>","","","<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Monoton' rel='stylesheet'>","<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Bungee Shade' rel='stylesheet'>","<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Akronim' rel='stylesheet'>","<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Play\" />","    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assests/css/style.css\" type=\"text/css\">","</head>"]}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":38},"end":{"row":29,"column":89},"action":"remove","lines":["https://wallpaperplay.com/walls/full/5/2/1/6019.jpg"],"id":120},{"start":{"row":29,"column":38},"end":{"row":29,"column":125},"action":"insert","lines":["http://backgrounddownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gaming-background-images-5.jpg"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":300,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":29,"column":125},"end":{"row":29,"column":125},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":true,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":69,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/html"}},"timestamp":1572302522178}
