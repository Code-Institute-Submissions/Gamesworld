### Introduction
This is my gaming website for all users interested in gaming or who enjoy gaming. The webpage shows my skills in creating a website design, adding material such as information, features, videos, additional features such as interactive headers and footers. A have attached a link below to the webpage for viewing purposes.

### UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design. The greyscale color scheme was selected to create a sleek and modern feel. I used a color, which I thought would get the users attention instantly and based the colors on the page on the background I selected. I originally wanted to use orange, black and white but did not think it stood out as much. This is a hobby and interest of mine, which made it interesting and was good to test my skills and make interactive but simple to use for others. I will provide by github information for all the information supplied and used when completed the design. I have used text relevant to the page and users which would be worthy of the page their viewing. Wireframes attached to the projects.

### Features
Features The navbar for the games section uses a drop-down list for the various games on the web page to make it easier for a customer to find them. The media links also direct to the game solely if available and provide direct information on the game and video clip for interest.
The games that have media present on the web page the video can play as normal via the mobile and desktop pages.
The alert bar links to the media page direct from the news page and the home page.
The game pad on the mobile version brings the drop-down list onto the screen for the user to select the option they want.
Features to add Users can navigate to the social media links if required only for testing purposes if the gaming page had pages set up.

### Testing
Testing When viewing the home page, the background is only displayed with the welcome message and the site name. It stays in the container and doesn’t move and take over the whole body of the web page. The rest of the page (body) is a white background with the media provided for all the web sites. All the social media links direct to their home web site for testing purposes and confirm to link correctly.
Tested the various links and on the pages ensuring they connected to the correct page when necessary. I checked both mobile and desktop versions worked correctly displaying all the pages. Media alert works correctly providing a link direct to the media page only on the home page and media page. The sign-up button brings up a pop up but does not link the information anywhere just for testing purposes with the site. All the pages link to together and divert to the correct site. E.g. click media and selecting e.g. game one it will take you to the correct game.
The websites have been tested on various phone types and internet explorer pages. (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the setup I realized the mobile version had a column on the right-hand side this was resolved due to unclosed rows, duplicate code and also amended any columns necessary.

### Deployment
Deployment This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html due to git-hub processes. To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/tomod24/Gamesworld/tree/master/GamingWorldProject into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.

### Credits
