## Design

### Inspiration:

My Interest in gaming and appealing to other gamers was my motivation for creating the website the idea was to be more direct with gamers and show what they want to see in games.

### Font

The Font selection decided for the website using google fonts was the play font. This reflected the aspect of the website very well and was perfect in suiting the gaming content provided. It suited everything about the website after researching and checking various fonts available. I was very happy with the selection as it gave the website a more gaming look and image.

### Colours

My colour inspiration came from the background of the website. I tried to integrate the design with the theme of the website. I took several colours of the background and applied them to the sections in the website and different web pages to keep the tasteful colour theme consistent. Each page has a colour of their own for a different section of the gaming website.

### Icons

The fonts used where from font awesome as there the most reliable and helped a lot with the correct design necessary on the website.

### Content Section

I aligned the information on the games with the video believing having a clip of the game aswell as soon information besides each other would be a perfect combo. Instead of most websites that have the information below that people don’t read.  I thought this idea would encourage them to play the video of the game and read together. Giving them an actual background on the game and enhance their interest. It was more impressive than I thought it would be with the colour scheme. I wanted the users experience to very friendly, colourful and professional when visiting the website.

## Wireframes
I decided the most professional tool to design my website would be Balsamiq frameworks. This would indicate how the website is to be reflected once it has been completed. It would give an idea to how I would like the site to be displayed for the users very easy to use an navigate.
Each page will have its own colour theme to separate them from each other to make it easy to know it’s a different area of the website each time. Below I have provided a basic indication how Id like the website to be not to complex just simple easy to use, clean and clear.

## Features

### Site features

### Welcome Page
* Originally the website had a fade in idea for the background and website on the welcome page as much as it was a good idea first. It didn’t serve a purpose. Instead of the user being impacted by the design and set up they had to wait for it. As I wanted the website to be simple, I decided to remove the intro and have the page appear as you see below.
* I believe the website set up in this manner appearing from the start instantly was a lot better had more impact than the website fading in. Therefore, the fade in was remove but coding left to show what was originally attempted.
 
![Final Title](https://github.com/tomod24/Gamesworld/blob/master/Documentation/image6.png)

### Wireframe Amends Home Page
* The main title was displayed in the middle of the page for the impact and the additional content on the main page was moved downwards away from the main title.
* The navbar was being impacted by the background therefore the navbar was provided a background colour to give the navbar content and title more impact on the page and not disappearing into the background image.
* Colour scheme inserted into the titles below to give them better impact and standout including brief information and an image to indicate the game.
* The spacing between the content, sign up area and social media icons was improved as it was too congested on the page.

### Content section
* Content idea was to be as clean clear and easy to navigate as possible not too much information congested in one area just the right balance necessary. This was the user can review the information and wouldn’t struggle to find the information necessary it would be there at first sight.
* The first page the news section is for the new games being released. This would have its own colour design theme with in the section of that content.
* The correct amount of spacing was supplied on the content idea so it was clean website which could be used very easy. The videos could be played when required and the information would be clearly readable. 
* The user could simply scroll through the games they would have interested in have a read watch a preview and enjoy what information they have seen on the webpage. With the theme keeping to the same colour aspect for that particular section of the website e.g. news, games and console. Including the home page having its own colour theme.

![console](https://github.com/tomod24/Gamesworld/blob/master/Documentation/image9.png)

### Wireframe Amends – Content Section
* The colour scheme being selected correctly as I wanted the themes on each page to be different. I tried the same colour for each section and the impact wasn’t as good.
* The Console page had to be correctly amended due to the image required to be the same for each one. They were fitted correctly with the text aligned and the titles centered as required. PS4 was the title for PlayStation and didn’t correctly suit the page. As a result, it was amended to the full gaming name to fit better and suit the website more.
* The video and text were brought closer together due to the original design having too much space between the two different content types. As a result, it worker better on the page and was a lot more suited to the style I wanted for the web page. The video sizes were also amended as they were too large on the original design, they have been re-sized for a tidier website and design.

### Footer Section
* The footer I wanted to be links to the main social media feeds as required. The links and images weren’t to be too bulky. I just wanted them to be neat and tidy on the website.
* On the home page there is a sign-up button for more information and on the other page’s news, games and console the link is just to the social media feed.

![newsmain](https://github.com/tomod24/Gamesworld/blob/master/Documentation/image%2011.png)

### Wireframe Amends – Footer Section
* The media feeds lead to the social feeds as required until social media platforms for the website are made, they just direct to their correct destinations. Small logos were used and used the back ground to blend in and suit the website theme better.

### Features to Improve/Implement
1. More content overall goal
Improving the content and use of the website could be for other company’s if they wish to do so is request links to their page to buy the products. This would be helpful to help the website improve via funding if required and also advertise more the games available. The game creators could send exclusive looks into games coming soon and could help impact the game reviewing and popularity of the website. (Long term goal).
2. Sign up button improved feature/newsletter
Sign up button is required to be improved and work correctly linking the user’s details so they get the content they want this would be a newsletter weekly or monthly. Emails would be required to be updated and automated once completed. With game news for example or release dates.
3. Updating future content more regular and more sections
The website has the information required but can always be improved this can the website content and more improved sections the users could use and benefit from. Including where to buy items. Providing a list of games similar or of the same game type/genre and content being updated more regularly. 

## Technologies used
For the website the following programming languages have been used HTML, CSS and Javascript programming languages.

* GitHub – The project required and believed Github was the best for storing the projects details and easily be used for remote access when required.
* ontAwesome – Used the resources available to create the footer on the website with the icons necessary for the social media links.
* JQuery - used to simplify some DOM manipulation for certain functions
* GitPod – Great toll to be sued for the development of the website and using the platform to complete the website as required. This helped fulfil the potential to complete the website.
* Bootstrap - Utilized to simply html structure of website and responsiveness of it. Popper also used to be able to enable some Bootstrap functionality

## Testing
* Testing When viewing the home page, the background is only displayed with the welcome message and the site name. 
* It stays in the container and doesn’t move and take over the whole body of the web page. The rest of the page (body) is a white background with the media provided for all the web sites. 
* All the social media links direct to their home web site for testing purposes and confirm to link correctly. 
* Tested the various links and on the pages ensuring they connected to the correct page when necessary. 
* I checked both mobile and desktop versions worked correctly displaying all the pages. Media alert works correctly providing a link direct to the media page only on the home page and media page. 
* The sign-up button brings up a pop up but does not link the information anywhere just for testing purposes with the site. 
* All the pages link to together and divert to the correct site. E.g. clicking the games on the welcome page take you to the correct web page for information.
* The websites have been tested on various phone types and internet explorer pages. 

| Browser  | Portable Device  |
|---|---|
| Chrome  | iPhone Models |
| Safari  | Mobile Chrome  |
| Internet Explorer  | Ipads  |
| Firefox  | Samsung Tablets  |

(Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 
* During the setup I realized the mobile version had a column on the right-hand side this was resolved due to unclosed rows, duplicate code and also amended any columns necessary.
* Sign up button which has been confirmed to be improved
